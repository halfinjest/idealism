# idealism

Quantifies the unpredictability idealism of a bitstring.

## Usage

Set the bitstring input to the desired configuration, and use:

`python idealism.py`

I have also created a much faster [C implementation](http://halfinjest.com/idealism.c) of this program, which performs exactly the same function, but much more quickly.
