# randomness

Quantifies the randomness of a bitstring.

## Usage

Set the bitstring input to the desired configuration, and use:

`python randomness.py`

I have also created a much faster [C implementation](http://halfinjest.com/randomness.c) of this program, which performs exactly the same function, but much more quickly.
